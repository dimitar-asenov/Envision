/**
 * The Node class is the foundation element in the model tree in Envision. An application in Envision is a collection of
 * objects of type Node (and derived) that are managed by a single Model object. Nodes are combined together in a tree
 * structure. This class defines the minimal interface of each node and implements some service functions.
 *
 * Each class that derives from Node must have at least two constructors which need to be registered before that class
 * can be used. This is achieved using the static method 'registerNodeType()'.
 *
 * Derived classes must implement the 'save()' and 'load()' methods that specify how the node is stored in a persistent
 * store.
 *
 * A new class that derives from Node must define many standard methods and constructors. Many macros have been defined
 * that greatly simplify this task. See 'nodeMacros.h' for more details.
 *
 * A node in the tree has a revision number. Each time a node is created or loaded from a persistent store this number
 * is reset to 0. Any modification to the node causes the revision to be incremented. This can be then used by
 * visualizations or other plug-ins to track the evolution of node and update it necessary. A node's revision number
 * will also increase when any of its descendants is modified, added or removed.
 *
 * A node that supports partial loading, should reimplement the 'loadFully()' method to enable this functionality.
 *
 * The functionality offered by the Node class includes:
 * - Navigation routines between parents and children.
 * - Navigation routines between different subtrees.
 * - Revision control.
 * - Persistent store interaction.
 * - Meta information.
