/**
 * The TreeManager class is a management and access entity for a program tree.
 *
 * Each program or project in Envision is represented as a tree of nodes. To manage this tree each project has an
 * associated TreeManager object.
 *
 * The life cycle of a project begins with the creation of a new TreeManager object. This object can then be populated
 * with program nodes by loading an existing tree from a persistent store or by creating a new tree structure.
 *
 * Further access and operations on the tree are performed through the TreeManager object. Here is a list of the
 * functionality of a TreeManager:
 * - Root node creation
 * - Saving/loading a project to/from a persistent store
 * - Access control to nodes in a concurrent setting
 * - Undo/redo functionality
 * - Notifications of project change
