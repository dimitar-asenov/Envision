/*! \page dev_tut_add_vis Adding a new visualization item

In this tutorial we will see how to add a custom visualization for a node. We will create a visualization for if
statement nodes. We showed how to create this node type in \ref dev_tut_add_node . You should be familiar with that
tutorial before reading on. In the present tutorial we will use OOVisualization::VIfStatement as example.

\section intro Introduction

Visual objects in Envision are called items. The name comes from the super type of all visualizations which is
Visualization::Item (which in turn inherits from Qt's QGraphicsItem).

To draw something on the scene (Envision's visual canvas), an item can do any combination of the following:
	- Draw directly on the scene, by using Qt's QPainter drawing methods.
	- Contain child items which themselves may draw something.

Envision already provides many useful items that directly draw on the scene. Typically these are used as leaves in a
more complicated rendering tree. Most newly created visualizations therefore are only concerned with defining
what child items they contain and how they should be arranged on the screen. Our example, OOVisualization::VIfStatement,
also does not draw anything itself. Instead it creates a number of child items and arranges them using a layout.

The easiest way to arrange child items is to use the services of Visualization::DeclarativeItem. Items inheriting from
it have at their disposal a powerful and fast layout manager inspired by GUI frameworks. For detailed information
on this declarative framework please see
<a href="http://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/infk/chair-program-method/pm/documents/Education/Theses/Andrea_Helfenstein_BA_report.pdf">
Andrea Helfenstein's Bachelor Thesis Report</a>. Below we will only cover parts of it that are relevant for our
example.

\section vif_header VIfStatement.h

Here is \c VIfStatement.h :
\include OOVisualization/src/statements/VIfStatement.h

Let's examine it starting from the top. The first interesting bit after the includes is:
\skip OOVISUALIZATION_API VIfStatement
\until {

When creating visualizations a lot of functionality is configured by inheriting from appropriate template classes.

Like for nodes, we use the \c Super template to specify the base class.

In this case the 'real' base class is OOVisualization::VStatementItem. OOVisualization::VStatementItem is really just a
very thin wrapper on top of the Visualization::ItemWithNode. The only reason we use OOVisualization::VStatementItem is
so that we can later set a default handler for all visualizations of statements. This is not important for this
tutorial, so we'll just use the fact that we inherit from Visualization::ItemWithNode. What is this template?

An item either stands on its own or represents the contents of a node. Examples of the former are labels,
decorative lines, and icons, while examples of the latter are visualizations of classes, methods, expressions, etc.
Items, which do not represent a node, inherit directly from Visualization::Item, whereas items that visualize a
particular node type inherit from Visualization::ItemWithNode (which ultimately also inherits from
Visualization::Item). This class provides the necessary association between the visualization and an instance of
a node that our visualization represents. We can gain access to this instance by using the \c node()
method within our visualization. The Visualization::ItemWithNode template requires 3 parameters:
	- The visualization that is currently being defined (in this case OOVisualization::VIfStatement)
	- The base item type (in this case Visualization::DeclarativeItem since we want to use layouts)
	- The type of the node that's being visualized (in this case OOModel::IfStatement)

The first and last bit are straight forward, but let's look at the second argument. In essence
Visualization::ItemWithNode will inherit from whatever class we provide here. This needs to be a sub type of
Visualization::Item. By specifying Visualization::DeclarativeItem we make it one of the super types of
OOVisualization::VIfStatement and can make use of its services which greatly simplify the layouting of child items.

Here is the complete type hierarchy of the OOVisualization::VIfStatement visualization:

OOVisualization::VIfStatement <--  Super  <--  OOVisualization::VStatementItem <-- Visualization::ItemWithNode <-- 
Visualization::DeclarativeItem <-- Visualization::DeclarativeItemBase <-- Visualization::Item  <-- QGraphicsItem

A note on the name of the visualization class: when you create a new 'stand-alone' item, you are free to call it
anything. By convention, items that visualize nodes from the tree should have the same name as the node type, with a
'V' prefix (for visualization). In our example we are visualizing nodes of type OOModel::IfStatement so the
corresponding item class is called OOVisualization::VIfStatement.


Next comes this line:
\skipline ITEM_COMMON
All items must include this macro as the first line in their declaration. This is similar to what we saw when creating
new nodes - we use this macro to save us writing a ton of boilerplate code manually (unfortunately, it's not possible
to replace the macro with a template solution). Among other things, this macro defines the style for this item
to be a class called just like the item class with an added "Style" suffix. In this case the style class for
OOVisualization::VIfStatement is OOVisualization::VIfStatementStyle. Sometimes it is useful to manually specify what
the style class for an item should be called (e.g. when you want to use the same style for multiple items). In that
case you can use the macro \c ITEM_COMMON_CUSTOM_STYLENAME instead which also takes an additional style class name
as an argument.

For more info about styles see \ref styles at the end of this tutorial.

Next we have the constructor:

\skipline VIfStatement(Item\*
All items representing a node (inheriting from Visualization::ItemWithNode) must have a constructor of this form.
The \a style argument should always be initialized by default to \c itemStyles().get() - equivalent to
\c itemStyles().get("default") - which returns the default style.
\c itemStyles() is a static method introduced by the \c ITEM_COMMON macro. You can use \c itemStyles().get(styleName) to
get the style defined by the file called \a styleName in the item's style directory.

Items that do not visualize nodes, must declare a similar constructor but omit the \c node parameter.

After the constructor we have just a few getter methods for the correspondingly named fields:
\skip condition()
\until icon()

Nothing special, let's go on to the first important method definition:
\skipline initializeForms()
This is a static method required by Visualization::DeclarativeItem. This method defines the layout for all children of
the class. We will see how this is done when discussing the \c .cpp file.

Next comes another related method:
\skipline determineForm()
This is another method used by Visualization::DeclarativeItem. A declarative item may declare multiple forms (layouts).
If this is the case, then the \c determineForm() method should be overridden in order to tell the declarative framework
which form to use. Many items only declare a single layout, in which case there is no need to redefine this method.

We go on to another method:
\skipline updateGeometry(
To understand this method we will first explain Envision's visualization mechanism in more detail.

To improve performance the visualization work flow is split into two major parts:
	- Painting on the scene
	- Updating the visualizations
	
\b Painting is mostly controlled by Qt. Various events trigger a repaint of the whole scene or parts of it. These are
for example scrolling the view, zooming in and out, interacting with the view, etc. Parts of the scene are repainted
often and Qt decides which items should be repainted. When an item needs to be repainted its \c paint() method is
called directly by Qt. Leaf items should reimplement this method in order to draw something. More often however, items
do not paint anything - they just include child items which do the drawing. In that case there is no need to redefine
the method.

The default implementation of \c paint() provided by Visualization::Item takes care of drawing a background shape if
any has been specified in the style.

\b Updating is part of the overall visualization mechanism defined by Envision. In order to make sure we do not always
recompute the entire scene, we only update items that need to be updated. For instance, if you just rename a class, only
that class and all its (visual) parents need to be updated - you don't need to recompute the layout for an unrelated
class or package. Envision automatically detects some situations that require an update to an item, and you can
manually request that a particular item be updated. Whenever an item is marked for updating, all of its parent items
are also marked for updating and the update begins at the root item. The update procedure is recursive and is embodied
by the Visualization::Item::updateSubtree() method. This is what happens when an item is being updated:
	-# The update proceeds only if the item has been marked for update, otherwise nothing happens.
	-# All child items are determined. Visualization::Item declares a pure virtual method \c determineChildren() whose
	sole purpose is to make sure that any child items have been created and set as children. Derived items should
	reimplement this method and maintain any child items in it. The method can also be empty if there are no child items.
	-# All child items that need updating are updated. This is a recursive call to \c updateSubtree() .
	-# The item's geometry is calculated. After all of the item's children have been fully updated and their sizes are
	known, the item must calculate its own geometry. Visualization::Item declares another pure virtual method called
	\c updateGeometry(). Derived classes must reimplement it and do at least the following two:
		- Set the position of all child elements. This is the layouting step, where we determine how our child elements
		should be positioned on screen. Keep in mind that all children should be drawn at non-negative \c x and \c y
		positions.
		- Set the item's own size by calling \c setSize(). It is important that the size we set completely engulfs all
		child elements. Child items should never 'stick' out of their parent element.
		.
	Some items have a variable size depending on where they are put. For example, horizontal lines expand in order to
	fill all the available space. To achieve this behavior an items must reimplement \c sizeDependsOnParent() to return
	\c true. This causes \c updateGeometry() to be called twice for this item:
		-# When it is first updated, the method is called with arguments 0, 0. These arguments indicate the
		\c availableWidth and \c availableHeight. Whenever they are both zero, this means that the item can take as much
		space as it needs and the parent item will make sure to accommodate it. All items always receive such a call to
		\c updateGeometry().
		-# After the parent has positioned all its children and set its size to engulf all child items, it should call
		the \c updateGeometry() method again for any children that indicate their size depends on the parent's size. This
		time at least one argument of \c updateGeometry() will be positive, indicating how much space the item can take in
		total in that direction, without changing the layout of the parent. The item can stretch to fill all the available
		space. If one of the arguments to \c updateGeometry() is 0, this means that the item should retain its current
		size in that direction. Any positive arguments provided in this second call to \c updateGeometry() can only
		indicate that at least as much space is available as the item originally requested, that is an item will never
		have to shrink in this second call, only expand.
		.
	The way this works for the line item is that it sets up a default line that is let's say 20 pixels long on the first
	call to \c updateGeometry(). Then during the second call the line will expand to take any extra space
	(say 270 pixels). Notice that there is no drawing during these calls, we merely setup the parameters that will be
	used for drawing later.

Now, let's get back to the \c updateGeometry() method of OOVisualization::VIfStatement. This class inherits from
Visualization::DeclarativeItem that provides an implementation for both \c detemineChildren() and \c updateGeometry().
So why do we need to reimplement \c updateGeometry() here? Indeed in most cases, when inheriting from
Visualization::DeclarativeItem there is no need to reimplement any of these methods. The reason for reimplementing in
OOVisualization::VIfStatement is to get information. We know that the \c updateGeometry() method will be called after
all children have been drawn. The reimplementation here just needs to know the size of these child items, that's all.
It doesn't actually do anything and leaves all the heavy lifting to Visualization::DeclarativeItem. When discussing
the .cpp file we'll see why we need to know the size of the child items.

Finally we have:
\skip horizontal_{}
\until icon_{}
There are some fields that will hold child items and another one called \c horizontal that will control which
form will be used to arrange the children. Let's see how it all works in the .cpp file.

\section vif_cpp VIfStatement.cpp

Here is \c VIfStatement.cpp :
\include OOVisualization/src/statements/VIfStatement.cpp

The first thing to notice is this inlcude:
\skipline DeclarativeItemDef.h"
We need to include this additional definitions header pertaining to the Visualization::DeclarativeItem framework.

Next is:
\skipline ITEM_COMMON_DEFINITIONS
which complements the \c ITEM_COMMON declaration in the header file. The second argument indicates which subdirectory
of \c /styles we should look in for the \c /VIfStatement directory that contains all styles for this class.
Possible choices here are \e "item", \e "icon" and \e "layout" for now.

The constructor:
\skipline VIfStatement::VIfStatement
is typical for items deriving from Visualization::DeclarativeItem, we just forward the arguments.

Here is the implementation of the \c updateGeometry() method:
\skip VIfStatement::updateGeometry
\until }
\until }
What's happening is this: If we put the \e then and the \e else branch next to each other and the total width is under
a specified threshold defined in the style, then we'll keep this configuration. Otherwise, we will put the \e then
branch on top of the \e else branch. We do this in order to improve the readability of if statements and also to
demonstrate how to use multiple forms with the declarative framework.

If we detect a switch from horizontal to vertical layout we need to perform an extra update so we request that the item
is updated again. Note that this is a rather specific situation that arises in OOVisualization::VIfStatement and
normally you wouldn't need to manually request an update in order to change forms.

Finally we call the \c updateGeometry() method of the super class to let it arrange all child items.

Given that we set \c horizontal_ in \c updateGeometry(), the \c determineForm() method is trivial:
\skip VIfStatement::determineForm()
\until }
OOVisualization::VIfStatement is a bit special in that you need to work with several methods in order to arrive at a
decision on which layout form to use. Normally, it is sufficient to perform some checks only in the
\c determineForm() method to decide which is the most appropriate form. In particular this is the case if the
decision is based only on the node that is represented, and not on any visual information.

Finally let's see the real work that we need to do in order to use Visualization::DeclarativeItem - defining the 
\c initializeForms() method:
\skip VIfStatement::initializeForms
\until ->put(TheRightOf, elseContentElement, AtRightOf, shapeElement));
We won't go into detail here, please refer to
<a href="http://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/infk/chair-program-method/pm/documents/Education/Theses/Andrea_Helfenstein_BA_report.pdf">
Andrea Helfenstein's Bachelor Thesis Report</a> for the various ways to use Visualization::DeclarativeItem. In short:
	- We create a \e header consisting of an \e icon an the \e condition. The \e condition is wrapped in a visual item
	that draws a background.
	- Both the \e then and the \e else branches are rendered using a statement list visualization.
	- We use a \e shape \e element that serves as the background of the entire if statement.
	- There are two forms:
		- Form \e 0 puts the two branches next to each other
		- Form \e 1 puts the \e true branch on top of the \e false branch.
		- Form \e 2 is for nested else if statements. Else branches are put under the then branch and they are no indented.

This is all there is to it - now we have a visualization for if statements that will be automatically used when needed.
In simpler cases, all you need to do is define the \c initializeForms() method and you can create a visual item in no
time. It is recommended to look at other examples when creating your own items. An example of a very short item is
OOVisualization::VTypeAlias, and an example of a more complicated one is OOVisualization::VClass.

\section styles Item styles
Each item type has an associated style type. A style type is a class that contains properties used to determine how
exactly the item should be rendered. For example an item rendering text may have a style that tells it what font
family and size to use, what text the color should be, should there be a background, etc. The properties defined for
a style can be other styles or any number of 'basic' values: numbers, booleans, lists, fonts, brushes, colors, etc. An
important feature of styles is that they are dynamically loaded at run-time by reading them from an XML file. Thus
all the properties that you specify in a style can be used to alter the appearance of an item, without the need
of recompiling any code.

Each item must have at least a default style that specifies all properties listed in the item's style type. Within
your plug-in you must put the default style in the \c /styles/item/ItemName/ directory and it should be called \c
default. For the OOVisualization::VIfStatement this file is \c /OOVisualization/styles/item/VIfStatement/default .

Creating a style class is straight forward, all you really need to do is list the properties of the style. Here is the
header of the style class for if statements \c (VIfStatementStyle.h):
\include OOVisualization/src/statements/VIfStatementStyle.h

There are three things to notice here:
	- The style must ultimately inherit from Visualization::ItemStyle. If your item inherits from
	Visualization::DeclarativeItem or another visual item that requires a more specific style, you must inherit
	from that item's style.
	- We always need to explicitly define the destructor. It must not be defined inline in the header file and should
	be defined only in the corresponding \c .cpp file. Almost always the destructor will be empty and it will be the
	only thing we put in the \c .cpp file. Nevertheless, this should still be done. The reason is that this is a hint
	to gcc, where to generate the virtual table for the class and other related data structures. If we don't do this,
	then this information will be generated in multiple plug-ins which will cause problems at run-time on Windows.
	- There is a list of properties that we want our style to include. Each property is defined by providing the
	type of information it should store. Additionally we need to provide \e this and a string to the property's
	constructor. The string is name of the tag in the XML file that will be used to read this property. By convention
	this should be the same as the name of the property.

The corresponding \c .cpp file is trivial and the same for most styles:
\include OOVisualization/src/statements/VIfStatementStyle.cpp

And here is the corresponding default XML file \c (OOVisualization/styles/item/VIfStatement/default). Things here can
get a bit clunky, but the important thing to see is that each top-level tag corresponds to a property of the style
or to a property of a base class. Simple properties like \c contentWidthSwitchTreshold are represented by values.
Properties which are themselves styles, follow an XML structure as dictated in their style class. To learn
more about how styles work see the documentation of the Visualization namespace.

\include OOVisualization/styles/item/VIfStatement/default
