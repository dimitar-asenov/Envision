/*! \page dev_tut_add_node Adding a new node type to Envision's model

In this tutorial we will see how to add a new node type in Envision. For this we will use the OOModel::IfStatement
node as an example.

\section intro Basics

Imagine you had an OO language that has if statements, and support for this feature was missing in Envision. You want
to extend Envision's OO model with a new node type representing if statements. Luckily, this is very easy to do if you
take advantage of some convenience classes provided by Envision.

To create a new node all you need to do is create a new class that inherits from Model::Node. It is possible to inherit
directly from it, but then you'll have more work to do. The recommended approach, that we'll demonstrate below, is to
inherit from Model::CompositeNode (either directly or indirectly). Model::CompositeNode provides a whole infrastructure
for declaring nodes that makes it really easy to define new node types.

\section if_header IfStatement.h

Here is \c IfStatement.h :
\include OOModel/src/statements/IfStatement.h

Let's examine it starting from the top. The first noteworthy bit is:

\skip namespace OOModel {
\until extern template class
In order to be able to put a node into a list of nodes, it is necessary to explicitly instantiate the Model::TypedList
template. This is necessary to support Windows as it can't properly handle templates with static fields otherwise.
With this first part in the \c .h file we prevent implicit instantiation.
Then the class is explicitly instantiated in the \c .cpp file.


Next comes the class declaration:
\skipline class OOMODEL_API IfStatement
The node declaration should use the plug-in's API macro and should inherit directly or indirectly from Node. When
specifying the base node type you must do so through the \c Super template. This is required by the underlying
framework. The \c Super template does two things:
	- Define a protected type called \c Super which represents the base class. This makes
	it possible to simply use \c Super anywhere where you need to refer to the base class. This is especially helpful
	when the base class is a long template instantiation. Inheritance via \c Super is used very often throughout
	Envision.
	- Import all constructors of the provided base type, so that your new node can call them.

In this case we inherit from OOModel::Statement, which itself inherits from OOModel::StatementItem, which finally
inherits from Model::CompositeNode. Both OOModel::Statement and OOModel::StatementItem are just marker classes that
serve only as a common base, grouping other classes together. For the purposes of this tutorial they are not
interesting. We really only care about the fact that OOModel::IfStatement ultimately inherits from Model::CompositeNode.

Next we notice the first line of the class declaration:
\skipline COMPOSITENODE_DECLARE
This macro needs to appear as the very first line of the declaration of any node that inherits from
Model::CompositeNode. There is a similar (also mandatory) macro for nodes which inherit directly from
Node - \c NODE_DECLARE_STANDARD_METHODS. Each of these macros needs to be complemented with a couple of macros in the
.cpp file:

For \c COMPOSITENODE_DECLARE_STANDARD_METHODS:
	- \c DEFINE_COMPOSITE_EMPTY_CONSTRUCTORS
	- \c COMPOSITEDEFINE_NODE_TYPE_REGISTRATION_METHODS

For \c NODE_DECLARE_STANDARD_METHODS:
	- \c DEFINE_NODE_EMPTY_CONSTRUCTORS
	- \c DEFINE_NODE_TYPE_REGISTRATION_METHODS

Together these macros save us a ton of writing. They declare many methods for the new node type and setup
required data structures. At some point there was an attempt to translate their functionality to templates
but the result was more verbose and less flexible so we stuck with the macros.

Next we get to the most interesting bit of the node declaration:
\skip ATTRIBUTE
\until setElse
With the help of the various \c ATTRIBUTE macros you can easily define what nodes your new composite node will consist
of. Here you see the simplest way of using the macro. You only need to specify the type of node, its name (which will
also be the name of the getter function for this child), and the name of a setter function. Each of these macro
declarations need to have complementing definitions in the \c .cpp file which we'll see later.

Finally we see a method declaration:
\skip findSymbols
\until override
This is an advanced function for the OOModel::IfStatement node. For simple nodes you do not need to define this
function. The only reason we need it here, is because it is possible to declare a variable inside the condition of
an if statement and we need a way to find this variable when resolving references. We won't go into details here as
name resolution is a big topic on its own.

This is it really. The essential thing for any Model::CompositeNode derivative is to declare what attribute nodes it
consists of. The rest of the code is just boilerplate.

\section if_cpp IfStatement.cpp

Here is \c IfStatement.cpp :
\include OOModel/src/statements/IfStatement.cpp

All of the things here are just the corresponding definition macros. The only interesting bit is:
\skip DEFINE_ATTRIBUTE
\until elseBranch
When defining the registered nodes you need to provide the following information:
	- The name of the class that you are defining
	- The name of the attribute you are registering
	- The name of the type of this attribute
	- A boolean flag which indicates if this node should be partially loaded by default. This should practically always
	be \c false as currently the partial loading implementation is not used.
	- Another boolean flag which indicates whether this attribute is optional or not. If you set this to \c false, the
	attribute is mandatory and calling the getter will always return a valid value. If you do not explicitly set the
	attribute, a default constructed value will be used. If you set this flag to \c true, the attribute is optional and
	calling the getter might return \c nullptr if the attribute has not been set.
	- A final flag that indicates whether this attribute should be saved to disk or whether it is transient and should
	only be used in memory. A value of \c true will make this attribute persistent. A value of \c false will make it
	transient.

\section allOONodes allOOModelNodes.h
This last step is really just for convenience and is not directly related to creating a new node type.

It is a good idea to provide an easy way for others to use all of the nodes you create. Typically this means creating
a header file which simply includes all of the headers files of the nodes you create. In the case of the OOModel
plug-in this file is called \c allOOModelNodes.h. If you are creating a new node within the OOModel plug-in
please make sure to add its header to \c allOOModelNodes.h:
\dontinclude OOModel/src/allOOModelNodes.h
\skipline IfStatement
