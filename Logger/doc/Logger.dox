/*! \namespace Logger

The Logger plug-in provides facilities to keep a system log.

It exports a Log class that can store messages of different error levels. A client plug-in can use the log to record an
event or to browse existing log events. Plug-ins (such as a visualization) can subscribe to the Log so that they get
notified whenever a new event appears. In this way users can be notified as as soon as a new entry occurs.
