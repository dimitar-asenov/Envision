/*! \page dev_tut_add_handler Creating a handler for a visualization

In this tutorial we will see how to enhance a visualization with a custom handler. More specifically we will enhance the
visualization for if statements that we developed in the \ref dev_tut_add_vis tutorial. You should be familiar with that
tutorial before reading on. In the present tutorial we will use OOInteraction::HIfStatement as example.

\section intro Introduction

All visual items in Envision process events through handlers. All mouse, keyboard and application events are passed to
the currently selected item by Qt, and the item directly forwards these events to its handler for processing. If you
do not do anything, a newly created item type will use the default handler which is Interaction::GenericHandler. That
handler already implements a lot of functionality related to copy and paste, selection, and others. However, sometimes
we want to customize the interaction of our visualizations. To do this we need to create a new handler class and
associate it with all visualizations types that it should handle events for.

In this tutorial we will look at the handler for the standard if statement visualization. This handler is
OOInteraction::HIfStatement.

\section associating Associating a handler class with an item class
To set a handler to be the default handler to be used by an item class you need to call the item class'
\c setDefaultClassHandler() method during the plug-in's \c initialize() method. Here is how this call looks in our
example \c (OOInteraction/src/OOInteractionPlugin.cpp):
\dontinclude OOInteraction/src/OOInteractionPlugin.cpp
\skipline OOInteractionPlugin::initialize
\skipline {
\skipline HIfStatement

Now let's see how to write the handler.

\section hif_header HIfStatement.h
First, we'll have a look at the header file. Here is \c HIfStatement.h :
\include OOInteraction/src/handlers/HIfStatement.h

Each handler must inherit from Visualization::InteractionHandler. In practice the only handler that directly inherits
from it is Interaction::GenericHandler. This is where a lot of common functionality is implemented. Therefore it is
recommended that all new handlers inherit from Interaction::GenericHandler. In our case the base handler is
OOInteraction::HStatement which is the default handler for all statement items. It implements some functionality
regarding creating new statements in statement lists and itself inherits from Interaction::GenericHandler.

Each handler is a singleton and needs a public \c instance() method that returns a pointer to the only instance. The
constructor is protected. This make it possible to create inherited handlers.

In the custom handler for if statements, we'll only customize keyboard interaction. Thus the only method that is
overridden is \c keyPressEvent(). For a list of all possible methods that can be overridden have a look at
Visualization::InteractionHandler.

Let's look at the \c .cpp file to see what this handler does exactly.

\section hif_cpp HIfStatement.cpp

Here is the complete contents of the \c HIfStatement.cpp :
\include OOInteraction/src/handlers/HIfStatement.cpp

As the rest is trivial we'll jump directly to the \c keyPressEvent() method and examine it piece by piece:
\skipline HIfStatement::keyPressEvent
Each handler method receives two parameters:
	- The \e target visualization. This is the visual item that received this event. It is safe to use \c static_cast
	to cast this directly to the item class for which this handler was registered. If you are using a handler for
	multiple visualizations then you should use \c dynamic_cast to distinguish between the different target types.
	- The \e event as received by Qt's Graphics View system. This contains info regarding the event (e.g. what key was
	pressed).

Since we only use the handler with OOVisualization::VIfStatement it is safe to cast it:
\skipline auto

Next, we ignore the current event:
\skipline ignore
By default, whenever we reimplement a handler method, Qt assumes that the event is handled. We need to mark the event
as ignored and then we can try to process it. Only if we do some processing, will we mark it as accepted (handled).

Inside the event handler we can do pretty much anything we want. We can alter the AST, change properties of the
visualization, schedule updates, move the cursor, and much more. In this particular case we want to provide some
shortcuts for navigating between the various parts of an if statement. We distinguish between the \e Enter and
the \e TAB keys:
\skip enter
\until tab
Generally speaking the \e Enter key moves us vertically down, while the \e TAB key moves us horizontally.

In the next part of the handler we indicate that we want to move to the \e then branch. Either by going down from the
\e condition or by moving vertically from the \e else branch:
\skip condition()
\until tab

If the right key combination is pressed, we will handle this event. Mark it as accepted:
\skipline accept

Next we need to check whether the \e then branch already exists (has items) or not:
\skipline size()
If there are already some items, simply switch to the first one:
\skip target
\until thenBranch
otherwise create a new empty expression and focus it:
\skip empty
\until SetCursorEvent
Notice how we explicitly request an update on the current item since we made a change to the tree.

The code for switching to the \e else branch when the \e then branch is selected is almost identical:
\skip thenBranch
\until setUpdateNeeded
\until }
\until }

Finally, the last action we react on is pressing \e Backspace or \e Delete when the icon is selected, or pressing
\e Backspace when the condition is selected:
\skip event
\until removeFromList
\until }
In both of these cases we completely remove the if statement from its enclosing list. Note that if the user presses
backspace when editing the expression in the condition, our handler will only get notified if the cursor is at position
0 in the expression (right before the if statement's icon). In other cases the expression's own handler will handle this
event by modifying the expression and we won't ever know about it.

Finally if the event wasn't handled here, pass it to the parent handler:
\skipline isAccepted

This is a typical reimplementation of a handler method. Look at other handlers in OOInteraction to see more examples.
