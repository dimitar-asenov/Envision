 * The Model class is a management and access entity for a program tree.
 *
 * Each program or project in Envision is represented as a tree of nodes called a program model. To manage this tree
 * each project has an associated Model object.
 *
 * The life cycle of a project begins with the creation of a new Model object. This object can then be populated with
 * program nodes by loading an existing tree from a persistent store or by creating a new tree structure.
 *
 * Further access and operations on the tree are performed through the Model object. Here is a list of the functionality
 * of a Model:
 * 	- Root node creation
 * 	- Saving/loading a model to/from a persistent store
 *  - Access control to nodes in a concurrent setting
 *  - Undo/redo functionality
 *  - Notifications of model change

		 *
		 * Only one thread can be in a modification session at a time. Furthermore this thread can only modify nodes which
		 * fall within the current access unit.
		 *
		 * Each node has a unique access unit associated with it. An access unit is simply identified by a lock. The
		 * Node::getAccessLock() method can be used to get the access lock associated with a node. By default this is the
		 * lock of the parent node, or if there is no parent node (this is the root node), the lock of the Model. The
		 * user can reimplement the Node::getAccessLock() method to return a new access lock therby defining a new access
		 * unit.
