/*! \mainpage Welcome to Envision

\section about About
	The Envision project aims to develop an IDE for object-oriented languages that features a visual structured code
	editor and is used for large-scale software development. 

	Envision is an open-source project using the BSD license. The project is based on the
	<a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt</a> framework and is cross-platform. <a href="http://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/envision.html">Envision was originally developed at ETH Zurich</a> in the context of <a href="http://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid=167548">Dimitar Asenov's PhD studies</a>.

	To read about the motivation for building Envision and find out what are some of the key ideas for the IDE, please
	see \ref motivation "the motivation page".

	Our CHI'16 talk presenting the results of a user study which shows that Envision's rich visualizations can
	substantially improve the understanding of code structure, compared to syntax highlighting.

\section status Development status

	Envision is still a proof of concept prototype and can not be used for programming yet. Nevertheless the current
	version illustrates some of the key visualization and interaction concepts for the IDE.

	Envision currently runs on Linux and Windows. Development is done in Linux. There are two code branches on GitHub:
		- \c master - contains an older, more stable version of the IDE
		- \c development - contains the latest changes and features. This branch is typically updated on a daily basis
		and might contain severe bugs. When the \c development branch is "in a good state" it is merged into \c master.

	\subsection implemented Implemented features
		- A core component that finds and loads plug-ins at run time
		- A small test framework for testing plug-ins
		- An extensible application model (AST) which currently supports a subset of Java (partial generics,
			no interfaces, no reflection, no libraries), and C++ (some templates, partial C++11 support,
			few 'exotic' features)
		- Flexible visualizations
		- Code editing using a structured editor
		- Ability to customize how AST nodes are rendered based on context
		- Rich comments, including formatted text, diagrams, and embedded HTML/Javascript
		- Partial support for importing Java code

	\subsection missing Missing features required for basic usability
		- Full support for importing/exporting to/from a programming language
